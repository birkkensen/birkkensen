### Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkkensen/birkkensen/main/images/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am soon graduating from Hyper Island. I am currently finishing up my internship at G-Loot, where I have been working as a frontend developer. Throughout my time at G-Loot, I have gained a strong understanding of technologies such as React and TypeScript. I have also had the opportunity to lead the frontend team of interns, giving me valuable experience in team management and leadership. I am now actively seeking a full-time position as a frontend developer, where I can continue to grow and develop my skills in this field and pursue my love for coding.

### :fried_egg: :skier: Hobbies and Interests

Apart from spending time behind the computer, I like cooking, skiing, listening to music, 3D-printing and traveling. A dream of mine is to travel to Japan for skiing, enjoy the food and culture, and climb Mt Fuji.
